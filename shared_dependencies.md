1. **React**: All the .tsx files will share the React library for creating the user interface.

2. **Firebase Authentication**: The "src/services/auth.ts" file will use Firebase Authentication for user authentication. This will also be used in "src/components/Login.tsx" and "src/components/Signup.tsx" for user login and signup.

3. **User Type**: The "src/types/user.ts" file will define a User type that will be used across "src/components/Login.tsx", "src/components/Signup.tsx", "src/components/Dashboard.tsx", and "src/services/auth.ts" for handling user data.

4. **CSS Styles**: The "src/styles/global.css" will be shared across all .tsx files for global styles. Each component will also have its own CSS file for specific styles.

5. **DOM Elements**: The id names of DOM elements in "public/index.html" will be used in "src/index.tsx" and "src/App.tsx" for rendering the React app.

6. **Package.json**: This file will contain all the dependencies shared across the project, including React, Firebase, and Typescript.

7. **tsconfig.json**: This file will contain the configuration for Typescript, which will be used across all .tsx and .ts files.

8. **Functions**: Functions for user authentication (login, signup, logout) will be defined in "src/services/auth.ts" and used in "src/components/Login.tsx" and "src/components/Signup.tsx". 

9. **State Variables**: State variables for user data will be shared between "src/App.tsx", "src/components/Dashboard.tsx", and "src/services/auth.ts".
